# Cliquet Options ‚Äì Monte Carlo Simulation & Return Capping

A Python toolkit for simulating and analysing the payoff mechanics of cliquet-style structured products ‚Äî which feature locally capped and floored returns, and globally bounded outcomes.

---

## üîç Overview

Cliquet options are path-dependent products that accumulate a series of capped/floored returns over multiple reset periods. These tools use Monte Carlo simulation and deterministic path logic to illustrate how cliquet structures behave relative to vanilla instruments ‚Äî both in final payoff distribution and in cumulative return evolution.

## üìò Scripts Included

- **MonteCarlo_final_distribution_cliquet.py**  
  Simulates and compares the final payoff distributions of vanilla call options and cliquet options using 12-month Monte Carlo paths, showing how local caps/floors and global constraints reshape the distribution and reduce volatility.

- **cumulative_payoff_with_without_floor.py**  
  Tracks a single 5-year asset path with annual resets to visualise the difference between raw returns and capped/floored returns over time, including detailed charts of per-period return truncation and cumulative payoff differences.
