# Fiancial Market Models and Simulations
Welcome to my repository!

I've created this repository to share various projects and simulations I've developed related to financial markets. Here you'll find Python implementations of quantitative trading models, derivatives pricing, and risk analysis techniques such as Monte Carlo simulations, Value at Risk (VaR), Conditional Value at Risk (CVaR), and option pricing.

The goal of this repository is not only to document my progress and learning but also to invite constructive comments and suggestions. I particularly welcome any feedback related to improving computational efficiency, refining mathematical models, and enhancing the robustness of financial algorithms.

Feel free to explore the code, utilize it in your own projects, or contribute by providing insights or improvements!

Happy coding!
