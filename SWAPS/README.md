# Advanced Derivatives & Structured Products Toolkit

A collection of Python tools designed to simulate, value, and visualise complex derivative instruments and structured financial products.

---

## üîç Overview

This repository brings together several independent, yet thematically connected scripts that explore the behaviour and risk dynamics of structured products, exotic options, and swaps. Each script is focused on a specific concept ‚Äî from barrier option path simulations to swap sensitivity and vega risk around barriers.

These models are designed for educational and exploratory use, combining theoretical finance with hands-on visualisation.

## üß∞ Scripts Included

- **MC_barrier_simulation.py**  
  Simulates and visualises up-and-out barrier options using Monte Carlo methods.

- **structured_payoff_diagram.py**  
  Graphs payoff profiles for structured products like reverse convertibles, autocallables, and capital-protected notes.

- **swap_valuation_sensitivity.py**  
  Shows how interest rate shifts affect fixed/floating legs in swaps, with dynamic PV analysis under different yield curve scenarios.

- **vega_exposure.py**  
  Visualises vega and gamma exposure for options near a barrier, with emphasis on convexity and risk zones.

## üéØ Purpose

This toolkit helps demystify:
- Non-linear payoffs in structured products
- Barrier effects on Greeks and exposures
- Interest rate sensitivity in swaps
- Volatility sensitivity (vega) in barrier environments

It‚Äôs ideal for students of derivatives, structured finance, and financial engineering.
