# 📈 Options Payoff Visualizer

A Python tool for visualizing the payoff diagrams of basic option strategies.

## 🔍 Overview

The Options Payoff Visualizer is a powerful tool designed to help traders, investors, and financial enthusiasts understand the risk-reward profiles of different option positions. By generating clear visual representations of option payoffs, this tool enables users to analyze potential outcomes across a range of underlying asset prices, making it easier to select strategies that align with market expectations and risk tolerance.

## ✨ Features

- **Basic Option Payoffs** 💰: Visualization of four fundamental option positions:
  - Long Call: Right to buy at strike price
  - Short Call: Obligation to sell at strike price
  - Long Put: Right to sell at strike price
  - Short Put: Obligation to buy at strike price
- **Breakeven Analysis** 🎯: Automatically calculates and displays breakeven points for each strategy
- **Customizable Parameters** ⚙️: Easily modify:
  - Strike price
  - Option premium
  - Price range for underlying asset
- **Clear Visualization** 📊: 2x2 grid layout showing all four basic option positions simultaneously

## 💡 Notes & Future Work

This project provides a foundation for analyzing option payoffs and can be extended in several ways:

- Adding support for complex option strategies (spreads, straddles, strangles, etc.) 🧩
- Incorporating time value decay visualization over different time periods ⏳
- Implementing implied volatility impact on option pricing 📊
- Adding interactive controls for real-time parameter adjustments 🖱️
- Extending to support multi-leg option strategies (iron condors, butterflies) 🦋
- Including probability analysis based on statistical distributions 📉

## 🧮 Mathematical Foundation

The payoff calculations are based on the fundamental option payoff formulas:

- **Call Option Payoff** = max(S - K, 0)
- **Put Option Payoff** = max(K - S, 0)

Where:
- S is the price of the underlying asset at expiration
- K is the strike price

The actual profit/loss factors in the premium paid or received:
- For long positions: Payoff - Premium
- For short positions: Premium - Payoff

## ⚠️ Disclaimer

This tool is intended for educational and research purposes only. Options trading involves substantial risk of loss and is not suitable for all investors. The visualizations represent theoretical payoffs at expiration and do not account for all market factors that may affect actual trading outcomes.
