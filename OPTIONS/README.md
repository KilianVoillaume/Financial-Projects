## 🔍 Overview

The notebooks and scripts in this section aim to build a practical, visual, and intuitive understanding of European options. By combining analytical formulas, surface plots, payoff visualisation, and interactive apps, this collection helps demystify:

- How options are priced under the Black-Scholes framework
- How each of the Greeks behaves across different market conditions
- How simple hedging strategies operate and evolve over time

The suite is designed for learners, analysts, and enthusiasts who want to develop hands-on intuition using Python and explore theoretical concepts through simulation.

## 🧰 Key Modules Included

- **Options Greeks Visualizers (2D & 3D)**  
  Tools to explore how Delta, Gamma, Theta, Vega, and Rho behave across spot, time, and volatility.

- **Options Pricing & Payoff Apps**  
  A static payoff generator and a live Streamlit app to understand how inputs affect price and risk.

- **Hedging Explorations**  
  Visual demonstrations (in included scripts) of Delta hedging, sensitivity decay, and exposure dynamics.

Each section is modular and documented independently with accompanying visual output.
