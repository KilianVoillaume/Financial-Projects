# Options Pricing & Payoff Visualizers

Two complementary Python tools designed to demystify options pricing and payoff mechanics ‚Äî using both static and interactive visualisations.

## üîç Overview

This mini-suite includes two educational applications aimed at building intuition around options contracts:

1. **üìâ Payoff Diagram Generator** (`Options_visualisation.py`)  
   A script-based visualiser that illustrates the payoff profiles of standard options (long/short calls and puts), including breakeven points and strike-related behavior.

2. **üìä Streamlit Pricing App** (`Options_Streamlit.py`)  
   An interactive Black-Scholes calculator that lets users explore how changes in inputs like stock price, volatility, or interest rates impact the price of a European call or put. Includes dynamic plotting and real-time parameter adjustments.

Together, these tools provide both static structural insight and dynamic pricing intuition for beginner-to-intermediate learners in derivatives and options trading.
