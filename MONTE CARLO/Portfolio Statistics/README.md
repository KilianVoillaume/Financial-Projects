# Monte Carlo Portfolio Simulation & Risk Metrics

A pair of Python-based tools for simulating multi-asset stock portfolios using Monte Carlo techniques ‚Äî with a focus on forward-looking distribution analysis and tail risk measurement via VaR and CVaR.

## üîç Overview

These two scripts implement complementary approaches to modelling the future distribution of a portfolio‚Äôs value using historical return statistics and random sampling.

- The **Portfolio Simulator** tracks thousands of portfolio paths under various assumptions and calculates projected value ranges.
- The **Risk Metrics Module** extends this by quantifying downside risk using Value at Risk (VaR) and Conditional Value at Risk (CVaR), with both visual and statistical outputs.

The simulations are built from real historical data (via Yahoo Finance) and incorporate return correlation through Cholesky decomposition of the covariance matrix.

## ‚ú® Tools Included

### üìà `MC_Stock_Portfolio.py`
- Fetches historical prices and computes daily returns & covariances
- Constructs random portfolios with weights generated by:
  - Equal weighting
  - Randomised allocation
- Runs Monte Carlo simulations of portfolio value evolution
- Displays:
  - Full simulation paths
  - Percentile bands (10%, 50%, 90%)
  - Probability of profit
  - Summary statistics (min, max, mean, median)

### ‚ö†Ô∏è `MC_VaR_CVaR.py`
- Runs the same type of Monte Carlo simulation as above
- Computes:
  - **Value at Risk (VaR)** ‚Äî the 5th percentile of returns
  - **Conditional VaR (CVaR)** ‚Äî the expected loss beyond the VaR threshold
- Provides:
  - Histogram of terminal portfolio returns with VaR/CVaR markers
  - Histogram of terminal portfolio values with tail risk markers
  - Overlay of all simulation paths with VaR and CVaR plotted as horizontal lines
