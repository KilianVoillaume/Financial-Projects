# üé≤ Monte Carlo Simulation Toolkit for Financial Markets

A curated set of Python scripts exploring the application of Monte Carlo methods in finance ‚Äî from basic option pricing to portfolio simulation and risk quantification.

---

## üîç Overview

This mini-collection demonstrates how Monte Carlo simulations can be used to model uncertainty, forecast distributions, and estimate prices or risk in a range of financial contexts. The tools are designed for both educational and analytical purposes, showing both foundational logic and practical enhancements like variance reduction or statistical interpretation.

## üß∞ Scripts Included

- **MC_Options_Pricing_BASIC.py**  
  A basic Monte Carlo implementation for pricing European call options under geometric Brownian motion.

- **MC_Variance_Reduction_Antithetic_Variates.py**  
  Enhances basic simulation accuracy using Antithetic Variates to reduce variance and improve convergence.

- **MC_Stock_Portfolio.py**  
  Simulates future value distributions of a multi-asset portfolio using historical returns and covariance structure.

- **MC_VaR_CVaR.py**  
  Builds on portfolio simulations to calculate Value at Risk (VaR) and Conditional Value at Risk (CVaR), with full visual output.

## üéØ Purpose

These scripts provide a hands-on illustration of:
- Random walk dynamics in asset pricing
- Statistical convergence in simulations
- Portfolio path forecasting
- Downside risk estimation under uncertainty

Each module can be run independently and offers modular code suitable for adaptation or extension.
